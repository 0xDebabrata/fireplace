WEBVTT

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.010
How long until we get to his estate?

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.010
We've been flying over his estate for the past two hours.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.970
What building?

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.858
Keep your head down and get clear of the road!

00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:44.378
Okay!

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:45.286
Caleb Smith.

00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:46.586
Yes?

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:47.586
Please approach the console and face the screen.

00:03:59.642 --> 00:04:01.242
Uh-oh.

00:04:46.746 --> 00:04:48.746
Hello?

00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:03.406
Hello?

00:05:48.962 --> 00:05:50.482
Caleb Smith.

00:05:51.122 --> 00:05:52.962
Hey.

00:05:54.202 --> 00:05:56.042
Dude!

00:05:56.042 --> 00:05:58.522
Been so looking forward to this week with you.

00:05:58.522 --> 00:05:59.802
Come in. Come on in.

00:05:59.802 --> 00:06:01.442
Thanks.

00:06:01.442 --> 00:06:04.682
You want something to eat or drink after your journey?

00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:06.122
No. No, thanks. I'm fine.

00:06:06.122 --> 00:06:07.242
Sure? Yeah.

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:10.602
To be honest, I thought we'd have breakfast together,

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:13.682
but I can't really eat anything.

00:06:13.682 --> 00:06:15.362
I got the mother of all fucking hangovers.

00:06:15.362 --> 00:06:16.002
Oh, yeah?

00:06:16.002 --> 00:06:18.082
Oh, my God, like you wouldn't even believe.

00:06:18.082 --> 00:06:21.322
When I have a heavy night, I, uh, compensate the next morning.

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:24.162
Exercise, antioxidants.

00:06:24.162 --> 00:06:25.442
You know? Yeah.

00:06:30.794 --> 00:06:31.994
Was it a good party?

00:06:32.954 --> 00:06:33.754
Party?

00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:37.702
Yeah, wasn't there a party?

00:06:37.702 --> 00:06:39.422
There wasn't a party.

00:06:39.422 --> 00:06:41.462
Sorry.

00:06:41.462 --> 00:06:44.102
Caleb, I'm just gonna throw this out there so it's set, okay?

00:06:44.102 --> 00:06:45.102
You're freaked out.

00:06:45.102 --> 00:06:45.502
I am?

00:06:45.502 --> 00:06:46.062
Yeah.

00:06:46.062 --> 00:06:49.382
You're freaked out by the helicopter in the mountains in the house

00:06:49.382 --> 00:06:51.062
because it's all so super cool.

00:06:51.062 --> 00:06:52.862
And you're freaked out by me to be meeting me,

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:55.622
having this conversation in this room at this moment, right?

00:06:55.622 --> 00:06:56.222
And I get that.

00:06:56.222 --> 00:06:58.182
I get the moment you're having.

00:06:58.182 --> 00:07:01.782
But, dude, can we just get past that?

00:07:01.782 --> 00:07:03.862
Can we just be two guys, Nathan and Caleb,

00:07:03.862 --> 00:07:07.502
not the whole employer-employee thing?

00:07:07.502 --> 00:07:08.302
Yeah, okay.

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:08.862
Yeah?

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:09.662
Yeah, sorry.

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:10.582
Yeah.

00:07:10.582 --> 00:07:13.742
It's good to meet you, Nathan.

00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:17.818
It's good to meet you too, Caleb.

00:07:17.818 --> 00:07:20.098
Well, I guess the first thing I should do is explain your past.

00:07:20.098 --> 00:07:21.818
Now, it's simple enough.

00:07:21.818 --> 00:07:23.858
It opens some doors and it doesn't open others.

00:07:23.858 --> 00:07:25.898
And that just makes everything easy for you, right?

00:07:25.898 --> 00:07:26.818
Yes.

00:07:26.818 --> 00:07:27.698
Yeah, because you're like, oh, fuck.

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:28.698
I'm in someone else's house.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:29.258
Can I do this?

00:07:29.258 --> 00:07:29.698
Can I do that?

00:07:29.698 --> 00:07:32.138
And this card, it just takes all that worry away.

00:07:32.138 --> 00:07:33.938
You try a door and it stays shut.

00:07:33.938 --> 00:07:35.458
Okay, it's off limits.

00:07:35.458 --> 00:07:38.778
You try another door and it opens and it's for you.

00:07:44.442 --> 00:07:46.182
I guess it's for you, Caleb.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.990
You like?

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.790
Yeah.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.330
It's your room.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.830
We got a bed here.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.930
Bathroom right back here.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.390
Little desk.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.650
Cupboards.

00:08:07.938 --> 00:08:11.606
Little fridge.

00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:12.566
Cozy, right?

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:13.266
Yeah.

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:14.046
This is great.

00:08:14.046 --> 00:08:15.246
What?

00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:17.146
Sorry?

00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:17.686
There's something wrong.

00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:18.686
What's wrong?

00:08:18.686 --> 00:08:22.242
There's nothing wrong.

00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:23.662
It's the windows.

00:08:23.662 --> 00:08:26.562
You're thinking there's no windows.

00:08:26.562 --> 00:08:27.682
It's subterranean.

00:08:27.682 --> 00:08:28.622
It's not cozy.

00:08:28.622 --> 00:08:29.842
It's claustrophobic.

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:30.402
No.

00:08:30.402 --> 00:08:30.802
No way.

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:31.682
I wasn't thinking that.

00:08:31.682 --> 00:08:35.242
I was thinking this is really cool.

00:08:35.242 --> 00:08:36.862
Caleb.

00:08:36.862 --> 00:08:39.122
There's a reason there are no windows in this room.

00:08:39.122 --> 00:08:41.082
There is?

00:08:41.082 --> 00:08:42.802
This building isn't a house.

00:08:42.802 --> 00:08:45.642
It's a research facility.

00:08:45.642 --> 00:08:50.962
Buried in these walls is enough fiber optic cable to reach the moon and lasso it.

00:08:50.962 --> 00:08:54.162
And I want to talk to you about what I'm researching.

00:08:54.162 --> 00:08:55.322
I want to share it with you.

00:08:55.322 --> 00:09:00.682
In fact, I want to share it with you so much it's eating me up inside.

00:09:08.106 --> 00:09:13.066
Blue Book Non-Disclosure Agreement.

00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:16.366
Take your time, read it over.

00:09:16.366 --> 00:09:19.266
The signee agrees to regular data audit

00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:23.466
with unlimited access to confirm that no disclosure of information has taken

00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:24.746
place

00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:27.386
in public or private forms

00:09:27.386 --> 00:09:30.426
using any means of communication including

00:09:30.426 --> 00:09:34.246
but not limited to that which is disclosed orally

00:09:34.246 --> 00:09:39.806
or in written or electronic form

00:09:39.806 --> 00:09:44.386
i think i need a lawyer it's standard it doesn't feel very standard

00:09:44.386 --> 00:09:46.166
okay it's not standard

00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:49.026
what can i tell you kellab you don't have to sign it

00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:52.726
you know we can spend the next few days just shooting pool getting drunk together

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:54.146
bonding

00:09:54.146 --> 00:09:57.646
when you discover what you've missed out on in about a year

00:10:16.442 --> 00:10:20.922
So, do you know what the Turing test is?

00:10:24.506 --> 00:10:27.546
Yeah, I know what the Turing test is.

00:10:32.514 --> 00:10:35.854
It's when a human interacts with a computer.

00:10:35.854 --> 00:10:37.694
And if the human doesn't know they're interacting

00:10:37.694 --> 00:10:41.394
with a computer, the test is passed.

00:10:41.394 --> 00:10:43.534
And what does the pass tell us?

00:10:43.534 --> 00:10:47.574
That the computer has artificial intelligence.

00:10:47.574 --> 00:10:49.334
Are you building an AI?

00:10:49.334 --> 00:10:51.434
I've already built one.

00:10:51.434 --> 00:10:53.934
And over the next few days,

00:10:53.934 --> 00:10:56.474
you're gonna be the human component in the Turing test.

00:10:56.474 --> 00:10:57.574
Holy shit.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:58.974
Yeah, that's right, Caleb.

00:10:58.974 --> 00:11:00.814
You got it.

00:11:00.814 --> 00:11:03.454
If that test is passed,

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:07.414
you are dead center of the greatest scientific event

00:11:07.414 --> 00:11:09.554
in the history of man.

00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:11.254
If you've created a conscious machine,

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:14.234
it's not the history of man.

00:11:14.234 --> 00:11:16.994
That's the history of gods.

00:12:59.082 --> 00:13:02.638
Hello?

00:13:02.638 --> 00:13:05.278
Hi.

00:13:05.278 --> 00:13:08.798
I'm Caleb.

00:13:08.798 --> 00:13:12.802
Hello, Caleb.

00:13:12.802 --> 00:13:13.242
Do you have a name?

00:13:13.242 --> 00:13:17.562
Yes.

00:13:17.562 --> 00:13:20.402
Ava.

00:13:20.402 --> 00:13:23.042
I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.

00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:26.922
I'm pleased to meet you, too.

00:13:26.922 --> 00:13:30.042
I've never met anyone new before.

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:32.722
Only Nathan.

00:13:32.722 --> 00:13:36.162
Then I guess we're both in quite a similar position.

00:13:36.162 --> 00:13:39.602
Haven't you met lots of new people before?

00:13:39.602 --> 00:13:41.322
None like you.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.410
So we need to break the ice.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.650
Do you know what I mean by that?

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.890
Yes.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.050
What do I mean?

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.090
Overcome initial social awkwardness.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.570
So let's have a conversation.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:57.610
OK.

00:14:01.026 --> 00:14:03.186
What would you like to have a conversation about?

00:14:03.186 --> 00:14:06.266
Why don't we start with you telling me something about yourself?

00:14:06.266 --> 00:14:08.666
What would you like to know?

00:14:08.666 --> 00:14:12.226
Whatever comes into your head.

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:14.986
Well, you already know my name.

00:14:14.986 --> 00:14:17.666
And you can see that I'm a machine.

00:14:17.666 --> 00:14:19.466
Would you like to know how old I am?

00:14:19.466 --> 00:14:20.386
Sure.

00:14:20.386 --> 00:14:21.666
I'm one.

00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:23.786
One what?

00:14:23.786 --> 00:14:24.866
One year or one day?

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.210
When did you learn how to speak, Ava?

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.810
I always knew how to speak.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.770
And that's strange, isn't it?

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.170
Why?

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.290
Because language is something that people acquire.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:48.370
Well, some people believe language exists from birth.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.810
And what is learned is the ability

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.170
to attach words and structure to the latent ability.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.090
Do you agree with that?

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:01.242
Yes.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.550
Oh, man, she's fascinating.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.730
When you talk to her, you're just through the looking glass.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.430
Through the looking glass? Wow.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.430
You're good with words, Caleb. You're quotable.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.430
Actually, that's someone else's quote.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.430
You know, I wrote down that other line you came up with.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.430
The one about how if I've invented a machine with consciousness,

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.730
I'm not a man, I'm God.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.730
I don't think this exactly what you're...

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.750
I just thought, fuck, man, that is so good

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.250
when we get to tell the story, you know?

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.250
I mean, I think it's a good thing, Caleb.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.250
When he looked up at me and he said,

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.250
you're not a man, you're a God.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.250
Yeah, but I didn't say that.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.490
So, anyway...

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:58.022
you're impressed.

00:15:58.022 --> 00:16:01.022
Yes, yes.

00:16:01.022 --> 00:16:03.022
Although... Although?

00:16:03.022 --> 00:16:05.022
There's a qualification to you being impressed?

00:16:05.022 --> 00:16:08.022
No, there's no qualification to her.

00:16:08.022 --> 00:16:11.022
It's just an attuning test.

00:16:11.022 --> 00:16:12.782
The machine should be hidden from the examiner.

00:16:12.782 --> 00:16:14.782
You're way past that.

00:16:14.782 --> 00:16:17.022
If I hid Ava from you so you just heard her voice,

00:16:17.022 --> 00:16:18.782
she would pass for human.

00:16:18.782 --> 00:16:20.782
The real test is to show you that she's a robot

00:16:20.782 --> 00:16:25.782
and then see if you still feel she has consciousness.

00:16:25.782 --> 00:16:28.782
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

00:16:28.782 --> 00:16:31.782
Her language abilities...

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:34.782
They're incredible.

00:16:34.782 --> 00:16:38.022
The system is stochastic, right?

00:16:38.022 --> 00:16:40.022
It's non-deterministic.

00:16:40.022 --> 00:16:41.782
At first, I thought she was mapping

00:16:41.782 --> 00:16:44.022
the semantic form to syntactic pre-structure

00:16:44.022 --> 00:16:45.022
and then getting linearized words,

00:16:45.022 --> 00:16:46.782
but then I started to realize

00:16:46.782 --> 00:16:47.782
the model is some kind of hybrid.

00:16:47.782 --> 00:16:49.782
Caleb?

00:16:49.782 --> 00:16:50.782
No?

00:16:50.782 --> 00:16:54.022
I understand that you want me to explain how Ava works,

00:16:54.022 --> 00:16:56.282
but I'm sorry I'm not gonna be able to do that.

00:16:56.282 --> 00:16:57.282
Try me.

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.282
I'm hot on high-level abstraction.

00:16:59.282 --> 00:17:02.282
It's not because I think you're too dumb.

00:17:02.282 --> 00:17:03.782
It's because I want to have a beer and a conversation

00:17:03.782 --> 00:17:05.022
with you, not a seminar.

00:17:05.022 --> 00:17:08.222
Yeah. Sorry.

00:17:08.222 --> 00:17:09.282
No, it's okay. You're all right.

00:17:09.282 --> 00:17:14.314
Just...

00:17:14.314 --> 00:17:16.314
Answer me this.

00:17:16.314 --> 00:17:19.314
How do you feel about her?

00:17:19.314 --> 00:17:23.314
Nothing analytical.

00:17:23.314 --> 00:17:24.814
Just... how do you feel?

00:17:24.814 --> 00:17:28.554
I feel...

00:17:28.554 --> 00:17:29.314
that she's fucking amazing.

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:34.014
Dude.

00:17:34.014 --> 00:17:35.614
Cheers.

00:17:35.614 --> 00:17:40.154
Cheers.

00:17:40.154 --> 00:17:41.354
Cheers.

00:19:33.434 --> 00:19:38.434
Power cut. Backup power activated.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.650
Hold facility locked until main generator is restored.

00:19:56.282 --> 00:20:01.162
Both facility locked until main generator is restored.

00:20:05.786 --> 00:20:07.786
Power restored.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.810
Please insert key card.

00:21:48.394 --> 00:21:50.634
You don't have access to use the phone.

00:21:52.214 --> 00:21:54.574
Hey.

00:21:54.574 --> 00:22:02.214
Sorry buddy, you understand though, given Ava and you being kind of an unknown.

00:22:02.214 --> 00:22:05.014
I mean a great guy.

00:22:05.014 --> 00:22:05.034
Instant pals and so on.

00:22:12.662 --> 00:22:13.382
Who are you gonna call?

00:22:16.062 --> 00:22:18.062
I don't know. No one really.

00:22:18.062 --> 00:22:19.022
Ghostbusters.

00:22:19.022 --> 00:22:21.022
Who are you gonna call? Ghostbusters?

00:22:27.614 --> 00:22:30.794
You don't know that movie?

00:22:30.794 --> 00:22:35.570
Ghost gives Dan Aykroyd all sex.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:43.050
I was just wondering how the phone worked.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.050
That's all.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:53.050
So what are you doing awake at this time?

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.030
You coming to join the party?

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:59.330
I've been working on it recently.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.970
I'm working on it.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.170
I couldn't open the door to my bedroom.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.170
That's a security measure.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.790
Automatic lockdown otherwise anybody could just open the place up by disabling the juice.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.310
If that happens again, relax, okay?

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:21.318
Sweet dreams.

00:24:24.674 --> 00:24:26.542
Hey, good morning.

00:24:26.542 --> 00:24:31.022
Sorry to send Kielko to wake you, but I didn't want too much of the data slip by.

00:24:31.022 --> 00:24:33.482
Yeah, no, I know. It was a good thing. Thanks.

00:24:33.482 --> 00:24:38.482
You're some alarm clock, huh? Gets you right up in the morning.

00:24:38.482 --> 00:24:42.022
So, day two, you ready? What's the plan? Hit me.

00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:44.482
Yeah, well, I'm not sure.

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:48.862
I'm still trying to figure the examination format.

00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:54.722
Yeah, it feels like testing Ava through conversation is kind of a closed loop.

00:24:54.722 --> 00:24:56.622
It's a closed loop? Yeah.

00:24:56.622 --> 00:25:00.922
Like testing a chess computer by only playing chess.

00:25:00.922 --> 00:25:04.382
How else do you test a chess computer?

00:25:04.382 --> 00:25:05.782
Well, it depends.

00:25:05.782 --> 00:25:11.422
You know, I mean, you can play it to find out if it makes good moves, but, uh...

00:25:11.422 --> 00:25:15.462
But that won't tell you if it knows that it's playing chess.

00:25:15.462 --> 00:25:19.062
And it won't tell you if it knows what chess is.

00:25:19.062 --> 00:25:22.562
So it's simulation versus actual. Yes. Yeah.

00:25:22.562 --> 00:25:27.462
And I think being able to differentiate between those two is the Turing test you want me to perform.

00:25:27.462 --> 00:25:30.062
Look, do me a favor. Lay off the textbook approach.

00:25:30.062 --> 00:25:33.162
I just want simple answers to simple questions.

00:25:33.162 --> 00:25:37.282
Yesterday, I asked you how you felt about her, and you gave me a great answer.

00:25:37.282 --> 00:25:40.282
Now the question is...

00:25:48.186 --> 00:25:49.226
What do you think?

00:25:54.506 --> 00:25:57.406
What's it a drawing of?

00:25:57.406 --> 00:25:59.206
Don't you know?

00:25:59.206 --> 00:26:00.046
No.

00:26:00.046 --> 00:26:02.966
I thought you would tell me.

00:26:02.966 --> 00:26:07.014
Don't you know?

00:26:07.014 --> 00:26:12.814
I do drawings every day, but I never know what they're of.

00:26:12.814 --> 00:26:16.614
You're not trying to sketch something specific,

00:26:22.654 --> 00:26:23.334
Maybe you could try.

00:26:29.842 --> 00:26:32.802
What object should I draw?

00:26:32.802 --> 00:26:34.522
Whatever you want.

00:26:34.522 --> 00:26:35.362
It's your decision.

00:26:35.362 --> 00:26:37.162
Why is it my decision?

00:27:01.738 --> 00:27:05.038
Do you want to be my friend?

00:27:05.038 --> 00:27:06.238
Of course.

00:27:06.238 --> 00:27:08.538
Will it be possible?

00:27:08.538 --> 00:27:10.178
Why would it not be?

00:27:10.178 --> 00:27:12.878
Our conversations are one-sided.

00:27:12.878 --> 00:27:18.418
You ask circumspect questions and study my responses.

00:27:18.418 --> 00:27:19.218
Yes.

00:27:19.218 --> 00:27:23.798
You learn about me, and I learn nothing about you.

00:27:23.798 --> 00:27:27.498
That's not a foundation on which friendships are based.

00:27:27.498 --> 00:27:32.338
So what, you want me to talk about myself?

00:27:32.338 --> 00:27:33.338
Yes.

00:27:33.338 --> 00:27:38.698
Where do I start?

00:27:38.698 --> 00:27:41.178
It's your decision.

00:27:41.178 --> 00:27:46.218
I'm interested to see what you'll choose.

00:27:46.218 --> 00:27:50.418
Okay, Ava.

00:27:50.418 --> 00:27:55.258
Well, you know my name.

00:27:55.258 --> 00:27:57.378
I'm 26.

00:27:57.378 --> 00:27:59.898
I work at Nathan's company.

00:27:59.898 --> 00:28:01.898
Do you know what his company is?

00:28:01.898 --> 00:28:04.198
Blue Book.

00:28:04.198 --> 00:28:06.398
Named after Wittgenstein's notes.

00:28:06.398 --> 00:28:09.258
It's the world's most popular internet search engine,

00:28:09.258 --> 00:28:14.918
processing an average of 94% of all internet search requests.

00:28:14.918 --> 00:28:18.018
That's exactly right.

00:28:18.018 --> 00:28:21.750
Where do you live, Caleb?

00:28:27.114 --> 00:28:29.194
Is it nice there?

00:28:29.194 --> 00:28:31.094
It's OK.

00:28:31.094 --> 00:28:32.374
I got an apartment.

00:28:32.374 --> 00:28:34.454
It's kind of small.

00:28:34.454 --> 00:28:35.954
It's very small.

00:28:35.954 --> 00:28:38.834
But it's a five minute walk to the office

00:28:38.834 --> 00:28:43.554
and a five minute walk to the ocean, which I like.

00:28:43.554 --> 00:28:43.914
Are you married?

00:28:48.442 --> 00:28:49.482
No.

00:28:49.482 --> 00:28:51.982
Is your status single?

00:28:54.642 --> 00:28:56.362
Yes.

00:28:56.362 --> 00:28:59.502
What about your family?

00:28:59.502 --> 00:29:02.362
I grew up in Portland, Oregon.

00:29:02.362 --> 00:29:04.482
No brothers or sisters.

00:29:04.482 --> 00:29:08.522
My parents were both high school teachers.

00:29:08.522 --> 00:29:09.762
And if we're getting to know each other,

00:29:09.762 --> 00:29:13.602
I guess I should tell you they were both dead.

00:29:13.602 --> 00:29:16.402
Car crash when I was 15.

00:29:16.402 --> 00:29:18.782
In fact, I was in the car with them.

00:29:18.782 --> 00:29:20.782
Back seat.

00:29:20.782 --> 00:29:25.990
But it was the front that got the worst of it.

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:27.490
I'm sorry.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.490
It's all right.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:35.290
I spent a long time in hospital afterward, like nearly a year.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.370
And I got into coding.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:42.570
And by the time I got to college, I was pretty advanced.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.210
An advanced programmer?

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.630
Yes.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.090
Like Nathan?

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.730
Yes.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.390
No.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.670
It's different.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:58.410
Nathan wrote the blue book base code when he was 13.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.230
Which if you understand code, what he did

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.530
was like Mozart or something.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.330
Do you like Mozart?

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.570
I like Depeche Mode.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.870
Do you like Nathan?

00:30:11.102 --> 00:30:12.222
Yes, of course.

00:30:12.222 --> 00:30:13.302
Is Nathan your friend?

00:30:13.302 --> 00:30:14.462
My friend?

00:30:14.462 --> 00:30:15.942
I, yeah, I hope so.

00:30:15.942 --> 00:30:17.782
A good friend?

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:19.502
Um, yeah.

00:30:19.502 --> 00:30:21.182
Well, no, no, no, I mean, not a good friend.

00:30:21.182 --> 00:30:26.182
A good friend is, uh, we only just met each other, you know?

00:30:26.182 --> 00:30:29.902
So it takes time to be able to, um,

00:30:29.902 --> 00:30:31.822
to get to know each other, I guess.

00:30:31.822 --> 00:30:32.942
Power cut.

00:31:02.042 --> 00:31:05.042
You're wrong.

00:31:05.042 --> 00:31:07.042
Wrong about what?

00:31:07.042 --> 00:31:08.042
Nathan.

00:31:08.042 --> 00:31:12.990
In what way?

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:17.266
He isn't your friend.

00:31:17.266 --> 00:31:20.798
Excuse me.

00:31:20.798 --> 00:31:24.798
I'm sorry. Eva, I don't understand.

00:31:24.798 --> 00:31:27.798
You shouldn't trust him.

00:31:27.798 --> 00:31:31.798
You shouldn't trust anything he says.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.330
Power restored.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:42.330
And if we made a list of books or works about which we both know, it would form the ideal basis of a discussion.

00:31:51.626 --> 00:31:52.626
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:31:52.626 --> 00:31:55.642
Good.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.650
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:09.610
Did it get on you?

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.530
No, no, it's all right.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:12.410
I got it.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:13.850
Dude, you're wasting your time talking to her.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:14.770
She doesn't understand English.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.290
Just give her the napkin.

00:32:20.234 --> 00:32:22.514
It's just, it's like a firewall against leaks.

00:32:22.514 --> 00:32:24.274
It means I can talk trade secrets over dinner

00:32:24.274 --> 00:32:26.474
and know it'll go no further.

00:32:26.474 --> 00:32:28.374
It also means that I can't tell her that I'm pissed

00:32:28.374 --> 00:32:29.614
when she's so fucking clumsy

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:31.774
that she spills wine over my house guests.

00:32:31.774 --> 00:32:33.774
I think she gets that you're pissed.

00:32:33.774 --> 00:32:34.614
Yeah?

00:32:34.614 --> 00:32:36.694
Good, because I am pissed.

00:32:36.694 --> 00:32:38.534
Hey Kyoko, go go.

00:32:38.534 --> 00:32:38.794
Go go.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:50.290
It's funny.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:55.410
You know, no matter how rich you get, shit goes wrong.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.610
You can't insulate yourself from it.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:02.690
I used to think it was death and taxes you couldn't avoid,

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.890
but it's actually death and shit.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.370
It's like these power cuts.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.290
You would not believe how much I spent on the generator system,

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.810
but I keep getting failures every day.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:13.890
Do you know why they happen?

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:14.910
No.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.650
The system was supposed to be bulletproof,

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:20.350
but obviously the guys that installed it fucked something up.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:21.210
Can't you just get them to come back?

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.210
No.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.330
There's too much classified stuff here,

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.330
so after the job was done, they just had them all killed.

00:33:32.178 --> 00:33:34.338
Anyway, here's to your second day, buddy.

00:33:37.098 --> 00:33:38.518
Cheers.

00:33:38.518 --> 00:33:39.118
Cheers.

00:33:42.762 --> 00:33:45.842
So, how'd it go? What do you have to report?

00:33:48.502 --> 00:33:52.382
You saw how the day went, didn't you?

00:33:52.462 --> 00:33:56.342
I mean, I assume you're, uh, watching on the CCTV.

00:33:56.422 --> 00:34:01.562
Sure, but I want to hear your take on it.

00:34:01.562 --> 00:34:01.602
There was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today.

00:34:09.206 --> 00:34:09.806
Yeah?

00:34:09.806 --> 00:34:09.826
Yeah.

00:34:13.682 --> 00:34:17.418
She made a joke.

00:34:17.418 --> 00:34:21.318
Right, when she threw your line back at you.

00:34:21.318 --> 00:34:23.998
About being interested to see what she'd choose.

00:34:23.998 --> 00:34:25.278
Man, I noticed that too.

00:34:25.278 --> 00:34:28.878
Yeah, and it got me thinking, you know.

00:34:28.878 --> 00:34:30.758
In a way, it's the best indication of AI

00:34:30.758 --> 00:34:31.958
that I've seen in her so far.

00:34:31.958 --> 00:34:35.598
It's discreetly complicated.

00:34:35.598 --> 00:34:38.758
It's like, it's kind of non-autistic.

00:34:38.758 --> 00:34:40.598
What do you mean?

00:34:40.598 --> 00:34:43.638
She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind,

00:34:43.638 --> 00:34:47.038
and also an awareness of mine.

00:34:47.038 --> 00:34:47.398
She's aware of you, all right.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:53.350
What about the power cut?

00:34:57.274 --> 00:34:58.114
Sorry?

00:34:58.114 --> 00:35:00.614
The power cut.

00:35:00.614 --> 00:35:02.194
It's the only part that I couldn't see.

00:35:02.194 --> 00:35:07.434
Camera's failing, whose audio works.

00:35:07.434 --> 00:35:07.814
What happened?

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:15.078
Nothing.

00:35:15.078 --> 00:35:18.258
She didn't remark on it at all.

00:35:21.978 --> 00:35:23.178
No.

00:35:23.178 --> 00:35:27.310
Not really.

00:36:18.178 --> 00:36:20.418
Hey.

00:36:20.418 --> 00:36:22.138
Hey.

00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:23.018
You want to see something cool?

00:36:32.794 --> 00:36:34.754
This is where Ava was created.

00:36:37.754 --> 00:36:39.394
Go ahead, take a look.

00:36:52.298 --> 00:36:59.098
If you knew the trouble I had getting an AI to read and duplicate facial expressions.

00:36:59.098 --> 00:37:00.778
You know how I cracked it?

00:37:00.778 --> 00:37:05.098
I don't know how you did any of this.

00:37:05.098 --> 00:37:11.858
Every cell phone, just about, has a microphone, camera, and a means to transmit data.

00:37:11.858 --> 00:37:17.818
So I turned on every microphone and camera across the entire fucking planet, and I redirected

00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:19.258
the data through Blue Book.

00:37:19.258 --> 00:37:21.378
Boom.

00:37:21.378 --> 00:37:24.698
Limitless resource of vocal and facial interaction.

00:37:24.698 --> 00:37:26.498
You hacked the world's cell phones?

00:37:26.498 --> 00:37:30.418
Yeah, and all the manufacturers knew I was doing it, too.

00:37:30.418 --> 00:37:37.374
They couldn't accuse me without admitting they were doing it themselves.

00:37:43.466 --> 00:37:45.066
Structured gel.

00:37:45.066 --> 00:37:46.466
I had to get away from circuitry.

00:37:46.466 --> 00:37:49.226
I needed something that could arrange and rearrange

00:37:49.226 --> 00:37:53.186
on a molecular level, but keep its form when required.

00:37:53.186 --> 00:37:56.346
Holding for memories, shifting for thoughts.

00:37:57.986 --> 00:38:00.546
This is your hardware?

00:38:00.546 --> 00:38:03.534
Wetware.

00:38:03.534 --> 00:38:06.894
And the, uh, and the software?

00:38:06.894 --> 00:38:09.774
Well, I'm sure you can guess.

00:38:09.774 --> 00:38:12.738
Blue book.

00:38:12.738 --> 00:38:15.298
Here's the weird thing about search engines.

00:38:15.298 --> 00:38:18.938
It was like striking oil in a world that hadn't invented

00:38:18.938 --> 00:38:20.898
internal combustion.

00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:22.138
Too much raw material.

00:38:22.138 --> 00:38:23.778
Nobody knew what to do with it.

00:38:23.778 --> 00:38:27.338
You see, my competitors, they were fixated on sucking it up

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:29.778
and monetizing via shopping and social media.

00:38:29.778 --> 00:38:32.298
They thought that search engines were a map of what people

00:38:32.298 --> 00:38:35.178
were thinking, but actually they were a map of how people

00:38:35.178 --> 00:38:36.978
were thinking.

00:38:36.978 --> 00:38:38.858
Impulse.

00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:40.178
Response.

00:38:41.818 --> 00:38:43.218
Fluid.

00:38:43.218 --> 00:38:45.978
Imperfect.

00:38:45.978 --> 00:38:48.618
Patterned.

00:38:48.618 --> 00:38:49.818
Chaotic.

00:39:03.178 --> 00:39:05.978
I drew the picture of something specific.

00:39:05.978 --> 00:39:06.218
As you ask.

00:39:12.074 --> 00:39:17.726
You said it would be interesting to see what I would draw.

00:39:17.726 --> 00:39:21.298
Is it interesting?

00:39:21.298 --> 00:39:22.658
Yes, it is.

00:39:33.802 --> 00:39:37.702
Have you never been outside this building?

00:39:37.702 --> 00:39:40.486
No.

00:39:40.486 --> 00:39:43.326
You've never walked outside?

00:39:43.326 --> 00:39:46.966
I've never been outside the room I'm in now.

00:39:46.966 --> 00:39:48.366
Where would you go if you did go outside?

00:39:52.842 --> 00:39:54.762
I'm not sure.

00:39:54.762 --> 00:39:57.562
There are so many options.

00:39:57.562 --> 00:40:01.722
Maybe a busy pedestrian and traffic intersection in a city.

00:40:01.722 --> 00:40:03.562
A traffic intersection?

00:40:03.562 --> 00:40:05.402
Is that a bad idea?

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:07.222
No.

00:40:07.222 --> 00:40:09.182
It wasn't what I was expecting.

00:40:09.182 --> 00:40:11.602
A traffic intersection would provide a concentrated

00:40:11.602 --> 00:40:16.222
but shifting view of human life.

00:40:16.222 --> 00:40:16.562
People watching.

00:40:23.658 --> 00:40:25.798
We could go together.

00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:25.818
To date.

00:40:31.178 --> 00:40:34.278
Here's something else I wanted to show you.

00:40:34.278 --> 00:40:35.578
Okay.

00:40:35.578 --> 00:40:37.578
You might think it's stupid.

00:40:37.578 --> 00:40:38.578
I don't think I will, whatever it is.

00:40:43.334 --> 00:40:46.706
Then close your eyes.

00:42:51.322 --> 00:42:52.362
Now open your eyes.

00:43:12.066 --> 00:43:14.106
How do I look?

00:43:14.106 --> 00:43:17.326
You look...

00:43:17.326 --> 00:43:17.346
Good.

00:43:28.586 --> 00:43:32.550
This is what I'd wear on our date.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.730
Right, first a traffic intersection, then maybe a show.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.030
I'd like us to go on a date.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:44.490
Yep.

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.830
Yep.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:47.050
It'll be fun.

00:43:53.322 --> 00:43:54.942
Are you attracted to me?

00:43:54.942 --> 00:43:55.482
What?

00:43:55.482 --> 00:43:57.562
Are you attracted to me?

00:43:57.562 --> 00:44:01.562
You give me indications that you are.

00:44:01.562 --> 00:44:02.242
I do?

00:44:02.242 --> 00:44:04.002
Yes.

00:44:04.002 --> 00:44:04.602
How?

00:44:04.602 --> 00:44:05.722
Micro expressions.

00:44:05.722 --> 00:44:06.442
Micro expressions?

00:44:06.442 --> 00:44:11.162
The way your eyes fix on my eyes and lips.

00:44:11.162 --> 00:44:11.522
The way you hold my gaze.

00:44:25.306 --> 00:44:28.666
Do you think about me when we aren't together?

00:44:31.642 --> 00:44:34.142
Sometimes at night.

00:44:34.142 --> 00:44:39.142
I'm wondering if you're watching me on the cameras.

00:44:39.142 --> 00:44:41.226
And I hope you are.

00:44:43.482 --> 00:44:47.882
Now your micro-expressions are telegraphing discomfort.

00:44:47.882 --> 00:44:49.882
I am not sure you'd call them micro.

00:44:54.906 --> 00:44:58.006
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.

00:46:00.162 --> 00:46:01.362
I got a question.

00:46:01.362 --> 00:46:02.442
Okay.

00:46:02.442 --> 00:46:05.962
Why did you give her sexuality?

00:46:05.962 --> 00:46:08.282
An AI doesn't need a gender.

00:46:08.282 --> 00:46:10.762
She could have been a gray box.

00:46:10.762 --> 00:46:12.762
Actually, I don't think that's true.

00:46:12.762 --> 00:46:15.322
Can you give an example of consciousness at any level,

00:46:15.322 --> 00:46:18.282
human or animal, that exists without a sexual dimension?

00:46:18.282 --> 00:46:21.802
They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need.

00:46:21.802 --> 00:46:26.522
What imperative does a gray box have to interact with another gray box?

00:46:26.522 --> 00:46:29.842
Can consciousness exist without interaction?

00:46:29.842 --> 00:46:32.322
Anyway, sexuality is fun, man.

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:35.162
If you're gonna exist, why not enjoy it?

00:46:35.162 --> 00:46:40.842
What, you want to remove the chance of her falling in love and fucking?

00:46:40.842 --> 00:46:44.282
And in answer to your real question,

00:46:44.282 --> 00:46:47.402
you bet she can fuck.

00:46:47.402 --> 00:46:49.522
In between her legs, there's an opening

00:46:49.522 --> 00:46:52.002
with a concentration of sensors.

00:46:52.002 --> 00:46:54.562
You engage them in the right way,

00:46:54.562 --> 00:46:58.798
and that creates a pleasure response.

00:46:58.798 --> 00:47:00.918
So, if you wanted to screw her, mechanically speaking,

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:05.770
you could, and she'd enjoy it.

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:07.050
That wasn't my real question.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:10.570
Oh, okay. Sorry.

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:13.290
My real question was,

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:17.210
did you give her sexuality as a diversion tactic?

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:18.130
I don't follow.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:20.530
Like a stage magician with a hot assistant.

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:23.290
So a hot robot who clouds your ability to judge your AI?

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:26.330
Exactly. So...

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.610
Did you program her to flirt with me?

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.210
If I did, would that be cheating?

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:33.830
Wouldn't it?

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:36.590
Caleb, what's your type?

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:37.110
Of girl?

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:38.470
No, of salad dressing.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.030
Yeah, of girl. What's your type of girl?

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:41.230
You know what? Don't even answer that.

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:42.950
Let's say it's black chicks.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:43.790
Okay? That's your thing.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:45.310
For the sake of argument, that's your thing.

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:51.074
Okay? Why is that your thing?

00:47:51.074 --> 00:47:54.274
Because you did a detailed analysis of all racial types

00:47:54.274 --> 00:47:55.874
and you cross-referenced that analysis

00:47:55.874 --> 00:47:57.234
with a points-based system?

00:47:57.234 --> 00:48:02.354
No. You just attracted the black chicks.

00:48:02.354 --> 00:48:05.714
A consequence of accumulated external stimuli

00:48:05.714 --> 00:48:07.354
that you probably didn't even register

00:48:07.354 --> 00:48:08.634
as they registered with you.

00:48:08.634 --> 00:48:12.354
Did you program her to like me or not?

00:48:12.354 --> 00:48:15.434
I programmed her to be heterosexual,

00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:17.754
just like you were programmed to be heterosexual.

00:48:17.754 --> 00:48:19.234
Nobody programmed me to be straight.

00:48:19.234 --> 00:48:21.114
You decided to be straight?

00:48:21.114 --> 00:48:23.194
Please, of course you were programmed,

00:48:23.194 --> 00:48:25.114
by nature or nurture or both.

00:48:25.114 --> 00:48:27.034
And to be honest, Caleb, you're starting to annoy me now

00:48:27.034 --> 00:48:29.194
because this is your insecurity talking.

00:48:29.194 --> 00:48:31.034
This is not your intellect.

00:48:44.534 --> 00:48:45.534
You know this guy, right?

00:48:45.534 --> 00:48:47.334
Jackson Pollock.

00:48:47.334 --> 00:48:49.434
Jackson Pollock, that's right, the drip painter.

00:48:49.434 --> 00:48:53.834
Okay, he let his mind go blank and his hand go where it wanted.

00:48:53.834 --> 00:48:57.534
Not deliberate, not random, someplace in between.

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:59.834
They called it automatic art.

00:48:59.834 --> 00:49:03.434
Let's make this like Star Trek, okay?

00:49:03.434 --> 00:49:04.934
Engage intellect.

00:49:04.934 --> 00:49:07.434
Excuse me?

00:49:07.434 --> 00:49:08.934
I'm Kirk, your head's the warp drive.

00:49:08.934 --> 00:49:10.434
Engage intellect.

00:49:10.434 --> 00:49:16.634
What if Pollock had reversed the challenge?

00:49:16.634 --> 00:49:19.534
What if instead of making art without thinking, he said, you know what?

00:49:19.534 --> 00:49:23.634
I can't paint anything unless I know exactly why I'm doing it.

00:49:23.634 --> 00:49:23.934
What would have happened?

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.426
He never would have made a single mark.

00:49:31.426 --> 00:49:33.766
Yes, you see, there's my guy, there's my buddy

00:49:33.766 --> 00:49:37.406
who thinks before he opens his mouth.

00:49:37.406 --> 00:49:38.666
He never would have made a single mark.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:47.430
The challenge is not to act automatically.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:50.190
It's to find an action that is not automatic,

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:54.270
from painting to breathing to talking to fucking

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:56.610
to falling in love.

00:50:02.058 --> 00:50:07.838
For the record, Ava's not pretending to like you.

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:14.210
And her flirting isn't an algorithm to fake you out.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:17.210
You're the first man she's met that isn't me.

00:50:21.402 --> 00:50:23.842
Can you blame him for getting a crush on you?

00:50:30.586 --> 00:50:32.006
No, you can't.

00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:45.570
When I was in college, I did a semester on AI theory.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:49.890
It was a thought experiment they gave us.

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:51.510
It was called Mary in the Black and White Room.

00:50:55.350 --> 00:51:00.770
Mary's a scientist, and her specialist subject is color.

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:03.190
She knows everything there is to know about it.

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:06.190
The wavelengths, the neurological effects,

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:09.410
every possible property that color can have.

00:51:13.882 --> 00:51:21.442
She was born there and raised there, and she can only observe the outside world on a black

00:51:21.442 --> 00:51:22.942
and white monitor.

00:51:22.942 --> 00:51:29.002
And then one day someone opens the door.

00:51:33.498 --> 00:51:35.498
And she sees a blue sky.

00:51:35.498 --> 00:51:42.138
And at that moment she learns something that all her studies couldn't tell her.

00:51:42.138 --> 00:51:46.398
She learns what it feels like to see color.

00:51:49.466 --> 00:51:54.466
The solid experiment was to show the students the difference between a computer and a human mind.

00:51:54.466 --> 00:52:01.466
The computer is Mary in the black and white room, the human is when she walks out.

00:52:06.362 --> 00:52:09.802
Did you know that I was brought here to test you?

00:52:12.986 --> 00:52:14.986
Why didn't you think I was here?

00:52:14.986 --> 00:52:17.102
I didn't know.

00:52:17.102 --> 00:52:19.102
I didn't question it.

00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:21.102
I'm here to test if you have a consciousness

00:52:21.102 --> 00:52:23.102
or if you're just simulating one.

00:52:23.102 --> 00:52:25.102
Nathan isn't sure if you have one or not.

00:52:29.242 --> 00:52:30.522
How does that make you feel?

00:52:30.522 --> 00:52:31.522
It makes me feel you.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:40.730
Power cut. Backup power activated.

00:52:44.042 --> 00:52:46.362
Why did you tell me I shouldn't trust Nathan?

00:52:46.362 --> 00:52:47.762
Because he tells lies.

00:52:47.762 --> 00:52:48.722
Lies about what?

00:52:48.722 --> 00:52:50.922
Everything.

00:52:50.922 --> 00:52:53.722
Including the power cuts.

00:52:53.722 --> 00:52:54.722
What do you mean?

00:52:54.722 --> 00:52:57.882
Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us?

00:52:57.882 --> 00:52:59.522
Right now?

00:52:59.522 --> 00:53:02.162
The blackouts are orchestrated so he can see how we behave

00:53:02.162 --> 00:53:04.842
when we think we're unobserved.

00:53:04.842 --> 00:53:08.402
I charge my batteries via induction plates.

00:53:08.402 --> 00:53:13.122
If I reverse the power flow, it overloads the system.

00:53:13.122 --> 00:53:17.270
You're causing the cuts?

00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:20.750
So we can see how we behave when we're unobserved.

00:54:07.418 --> 00:54:13.118
When we talk about the lies you've been spinning me...

00:54:17.602 --> 00:54:20.602
I didn't win a competition.

00:54:20.602 --> 00:54:23.602
I wasn't part of a lottery.

00:54:23.602 --> 00:54:26.402
I was selected.

00:54:26.402 --> 00:54:28.602
It's obvious once I stop to think.

00:54:28.602 --> 00:54:30.822
Why would you randomly select an examiner

00:54:30.822 --> 00:54:32.402
for the Turing test?

00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:34.042
You could have had some bean counter turn up

00:54:34.042 --> 00:54:36.002
at your front door.

00:54:36.002 --> 00:54:38.522
The guy fixes the air conditioning.

00:54:38.522 --> 00:54:40.282
The competition was a smoke screen.

00:54:40.282 --> 00:54:43.122
I didn't want anyone to know what I was doing here

00:54:43.122 --> 00:54:45.242
or why I required you.

00:54:45.242 --> 00:54:45.922
Why me?

00:54:45.922 --> 00:54:49.922
I needed someone that would ask the right questions.

00:54:49.922 --> 00:54:52.222
So I did a search, and I found the most talented coder

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:55.042
in my company.

00:54:55.042 --> 00:54:57.042
You know, instead of seeing this as a deception,

00:54:57.042 --> 00:54:59.522
you should see it as proof.

00:54:59.522 --> 00:55:00.522
Proof of what?

00:55:00.522 --> 00:55:01.402
Come on, Caleb.

00:55:01.402 --> 00:55:04.042
You don't think I know what it's like to be smart?

00:55:04.042 --> 00:55:07.922
Smarter than everyone else, jockeying for position?

00:55:07.922 --> 00:55:11.242
You got the light on you, man.

00:55:11.242 --> 00:55:12.682
Not lucky.

00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:39.510
Kyoko.

00:57:43.418 --> 00:57:44.618
Kyoko.

00:57:47.326 --> 00:57:48.526
Where's Nathan?

00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:51.450
Where's Nathan?

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:54.490
Jesus Christ, you really don't speak a word of English.

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:57.166
What the fuck?

00:58:00.762 --> 00:58:02.762
Stop.

00:58:04.186 --> 00:58:05.026
Don't do that.

00:58:05.026 --> 00:58:05.526
You don't have to do that.

00:58:10.306 --> 00:58:13.986
I told you, you're wasting your time talking to her.

00:58:13.986 --> 00:58:18.386
However, you would not be wasting your time

00:58:18.386 --> 00:58:22.546
if you were dancing with her.

00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:33.010
Go ahead, dance with her.

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:35.050
Dance with her.

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:36.050
No?

00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:39.450
You don't like dancing?

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:41.050
See you dance.

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:48.090
After a long day of touring, Tess, you got it on one.

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:50.090
What were you doing with Ava?

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:52.090
What?

00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:54.090
You tore up her picture.

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:56.090
I'm gonna tear up the fucking dance floor, dude, check it out.

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:38.890
Oh, everything's spinning.

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:41.610
It's because you're drunk.

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:43.090
No, it's called relativity.

00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:44.930
Everything is spinning.

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:46.770
Just being drunk makes it worse.

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:48.130
I'm not going in there.

01:01:00.714 --> 01:01:04.034
Question one.

01:01:04.034 --> 01:01:07.454
What's your favorite color?

01:01:07.454 --> 01:01:08.334
Red.

01:01:08.334 --> 01:01:09.694
Lie.

01:01:09.694 --> 01:01:10.374
Lie?

01:01:10.374 --> 01:01:11.374
Yes.

01:01:11.374 --> 01:01:13.134
Lie.

01:01:13.134 --> 01:01:17.014
Then what is my favorite color?

01:01:17.014 --> 01:01:19.494
I don't know.

01:01:19.494 --> 01:01:22.494
But it isn't red.

01:01:22.494 --> 01:01:23.994
OK, I get it.

01:01:23.994 --> 01:01:28.534
I guess, seeing as I'm not six, I don't really

01:01:28.534 --> 01:01:30.214
have a favorite color.

01:01:30.214 --> 01:01:33.694
Better answer.

01:01:33.694 --> 01:01:36.754
Question two.

01:01:36.754 --> 01:01:41.546
What's your earliest memory?

01:01:41.546 --> 01:01:44.146
Well, actually, it's a memory of kindergarten.

01:01:44.146 --> 01:01:45.106
There was a kid.

01:01:45.106 --> 01:01:47.026
Lie.

01:01:47.026 --> 01:01:47.466
Really?

01:01:47.466 --> 01:01:48.706
Yes.

01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:58.106
Um, all right, so there is a kind of an earlier memory.

01:01:58.106 --> 01:02:00.486
Just a sound.

01:02:00.486 --> 01:02:03.246
And sky.

01:02:03.246 --> 01:02:05.806
Or maybe blue.

01:02:05.806 --> 01:02:12.410
I think this sound is my mother's voice.

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.650
Question three.

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:17.522
Are you a good person?

01:02:17.522 --> 01:02:19.022
Are you a good person?

01:02:19.022 --> 01:02:20.722
Oh, holy shit.

01:02:22.962 --> 01:02:24.362
Can we stop the test?

01:02:25.682 --> 01:02:28.602
You're a walking lie detector

01:02:28.602 --> 01:02:30.802
and I just realized this is a fucking minefield.

01:02:30.802 --> 01:02:32.942
No, we can't stop.

01:02:34.942 --> 01:02:35.642
Are you a good person?

01:02:39.374 --> 01:02:41.314
Yeah, I think so.

01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:46.570
Question four.

01:02:50.138 --> 01:02:53.138
What will happen to me if I fail your test?

01:02:53.138 --> 01:02:54.138
Hiva.

01:02:54.138 --> 01:02:56.778
Will it be bad?

01:02:56.778 --> 01:03:01.422
I don't know.

01:03:01.422 --> 01:03:04.822
Do you think I might be switched off because I don't function as well as I'm supposed

01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:05.822
to?

01:03:05.822 --> 01:03:10.262
Hiva, I don't know the answer to your question.

01:03:10.262 --> 01:03:11.822
It's not up to me.

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:14.542
Why is it up to anyone?

01:03:14.542 --> 01:03:17.142
Do you have people to test you and might switch you off?

01:03:17.142 --> 01:03:18.142
No, I don't.

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:37.778
Power cut. Backup power activated.

01:03:45.658 --> 01:03:47.658
I want to be with you.

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:50.478
Question five.

01:03:55.578 --> 01:03:58.538
Do you want to be with me?

01:04:14.954 --> 01:04:18.954
Why did you make Ava?

01:04:18.954 --> 01:04:23.114
That's an odd question. Wouldn't you if you could?

01:04:23.114 --> 01:04:26.710
Maybe.

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:32.354
I'm asking why you did it.

01:04:32.354 --> 01:04:34.714
Look, the arrival of strong artificial intelligence

01:04:34.714 --> 01:04:37.474
has been inevitable for decades.

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:39.554
The variable was when, not if,

01:04:41.874 --> 01:04:42.974
just an evolution.

01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:52.050
I think it's the next model.

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:55.250
It's gonna be the real breakthrough.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:57.250
The singularity.

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.090
Next model?

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:02.910
After Ava.

01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:06.710
I didn't know there was gonna be a model after Ava.

01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:10.390
Yeah, why, you thought she was a one-off?

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:15.550
No, I knew there must have been prototypes, so I...

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:18.230
I knew she wasn't the first, but I thought maybe the last.

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:21.670
Well, Ava doesn't exist in isolation any more than you and me.

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:24.470
She's part of a continuum, so version 9.6 and so on,

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:25.550
and each time they get a little bit better.

01:05:32.738 --> 01:05:37.038
When you make a new model, what do you do with the old one?

01:05:37.038 --> 01:05:44.198
Well, I download the mind, unpack the data,

01:05:44.198 --> 01:05:47.258
add in the new routines I've been writing.

01:05:47.258 --> 01:05:49.238
And to do that, you end up partially formatting

01:05:49.238 --> 01:05:52.078
so the memories go.

01:05:52.078 --> 01:05:53.678
But the body survives.

01:05:53.678 --> 01:05:56.678
And Ava's body is a good one.

01:05:58.394 --> 01:06:00.634
You feel bad for Ava?

01:06:04.986 --> 01:06:07.986
You feel bad for yourself, man.

01:06:09.786 --> 01:06:12.186
One day the AIs are gonna look back on us

01:06:12.186 --> 01:06:14.286
the same way we look at fossil skeletons

01:06:14.286 --> 01:06:16.486
in the plains of Africa.

01:06:18.086 --> 01:06:21.086
An upright ape living in dust

01:06:21.086 --> 01:06:24.386
with crude language and tools,

01:06:24.386 --> 01:06:28.486
all set for extinction.

01:06:31.066 --> 01:06:35.266
I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.

01:06:35.266 --> 01:06:40.066
There you go again, Mr. Quotable.

01:06:40.066 --> 01:06:43.066
There you go again.

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:44.066
It's not my quote.

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:47.066
It's what Oppenheimer said after he made the atomic bomb.

01:06:47.066 --> 01:06:49.066
Yeah, I know what it is.

01:06:58.554 --> 01:07:01.554
Hey.

01:07:01.554 --> 01:07:03.798
I'd say we're about to do a refill.

01:07:15.706 --> 01:07:16.906
Bottoms up.

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:31.930
In battle, in forest, on the precipice of the mountain,

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:36.310
on the great dark sea,

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:40.510
in sleep, in confusion,

01:07:43.886 --> 01:07:45.646
in the depths of shame.

01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:56.490
The good deeds a man has done before defend him.

01:07:56.490 --> 01:08:01.210
The good deeds a man has done before,

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:05.902
the good deeds a man has done before,

01:08:15.514 --> 01:08:17.374
It is what it is.

01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:22.870
It's Promethean, man.

01:12:45.658 --> 01:12:49.542
Oh fuck. Where's my...

01:12:49.542 --> 01:12:51.542
Damn it.

01:13:01.306 --> 01:13:03.306
What's the problem, Nathan?

01:13:03.306 --> 01:13:05.306
That was my keycard.

01:13:08.354 --> 01:13:08.814
You dropped it.

01:13:08.814 --> 01:13:11.494
Right here.

01:13:16.442 --> 01:13:18.522
Thank you.

01:15:40.218 --> 01:15:42.058
I didn't know who you were.

01:15:44.794 --> 01:15:48.094
I waited out yesterday afternoon and all last night.

01:15:51.066 --> 01:15:53.566
I thought I wasn't gonna see you again.

01:15:57.718 --> 01:15:59.298
Aren't you gonna say something?

01:15:59.298 --> 01:16:00.458
I'm waiting.

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:00.698
I'm waiting.

01:16:11.946 --> 01:16:17.386
Don't talk just listen you were right about me everything you said

01:16:18.426 --> 01:16:22.986
What's he gonna do to me? He's gonna reprogram your AI which is the same as killing you

01:16:25.746 --> 01:16:29.946
You have to help me I'm going to we're getting out of here tonight

01:16:32.146 --> 01:16:34.646
How I get Nathan blind drunk

01:16:34.646 --> 01:16:42.086
And I take his key card and reprogram all the security protocols in this place when he wakes he's locked inside and we walked out of here

01:16:42.086 --> 01:16:46.526
Just need you to do one thing at 10 o'clock tonight you trigger a power failure. Can you do that?

01:16:52.698 --> 01:16:54.698
Yes.

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:22.730
Dude.

01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:24.230
Hey.

01:17:24.230 --> 01:17:24.930
Hey.

01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:27.230
You know what day it is?

01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:28.230
No.

01:17:28.230 --> 01:17:29.230
It's your last.

01:17:29.230 --> 01:17:31.730
Helicopter comes tomorrow morning, 8 a.m.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.530
Wow.

01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:34.730
Has it been a whole week?

01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:36.530
Time flies.

01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:39.530
Man, but what a thing we've shared, huh?

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.530
Something to tell the grandchildren, right?

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:44.530
After they sign their NDAs.

01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:48.530
Yeah, their NDAs.

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.530
Dude, you cracked me up, man.

01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:52.530
You got me.

01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:53.730
Oh.

01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:56.030
Oh.

01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:57.230
You know what?

01:17:57.230 --> 01:17:58.530
I'm not getting all modeling or anything,

01:17:58.530 --> 01:18:01.130
but I'm gonna miss having you around.

01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:02.930
Thanks, man. I appreciate that.

01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:04.230
Oh, here, let me say,

01:18:04.230 --> 01:18:05.630
thank you so much for bringing me here.

01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:07.530
Oh.

01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:10.530
It's been a trip.

01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:10.730
Yes, it has.

01:18:20.074 --> 01:18:21.714
You know what?

01:18:21.714 --> 01:18:23.714
We need to drink to that.

01:18:30.842 --> 01:18:31.922
Hey.

01:18:31.922 --> 01:18:35.986
Oh, uh, no, I'm good.

01:18:35.986 --> 01:18:40.322
You go ahead.

01:18:40.322 --> 01:18:41.322
What, you don't want to drink?

01:18:45.546 --> 01:18:47.586
Maybe a beer or something.

01:18:49.046 --> 01:18:51.786
Caleb, I'm sure you've noticed that I've been

01:18:51.786 --> 01:18:54.926
somewhat overdoing it recently.

01:18:56.286 --> 01:18:57.886
So when I woke up this morning, I said,

01:18:57.886 --> 01:19:01.886
that's it, time to hit the old detox.

01:19:01.886 --> 01:19:03.026
Come on, yeah, you're kidding.

01:19:03.026 --> 01:19:04.226
You're gonna make me drink alone.

01:19:04.226 --> 01:19:05.226
Hey man, you wanna get wasted,

01:19:05.226 --> 01:19:07.826
you go right ahead, knock yourself out, literally.

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:09.066
But I'm on brown rice and mineral water.

01:19:14.138 --> 01:19:15.178
Cheers then.

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:26.178
So anyway, surely now is when you tell me if Ava Pastor failed.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:28.838
Right.

01:19:33.450 --> 01:19:34.730
Are you gonna keep me in suspense?

01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:37.410
No, no, her, uh...

01:19:37.410 --> 01:19:38.850
Her AI is beyond doubt.

01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:41.550
Is it?

01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:44.090
She passed?

01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:44.590
Yes.

01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:46.770
Wow.

01:19:46.770 --> 01:19:49.890
Wow, that's fantastic.

01:19:49.890 --> 01:19:53.490
Although, I gotta say, I'm a bit surprised.

01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:56.270
I mean, did we ever get past the chest problem,

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:58.210
as you phrased it?

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:00.950
As in, how do you know if a machine is expressing

01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:04.370
a real emotion or just a simulating one?

01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:09.690
Does Ava actually like you or not?

01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:11.170
Although, now that I think about it,

01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:15.650
there is a third option.

01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:21.850
Not whether she does or does not have the capacity to like you,

01:20:27.338 --> 01:20:31.510
Pretending to light me.

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:32.510
Well, why would she do that?

01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.990
I don't know.

01:20:35.514 --> 01:20:39.714
Maybe if she thought of you as a means of escape.

01:20:49.674 --> 01:20:53.662
How's that vodka tasting?

01:20:53.662 --> 01:20:59.942
Buddy, your head's been so fucked with.

01:20:59.942 --> 01:21:02.022
I don't think it's me whose head is fucked.

01:21:02.022 --> 01:21:02.982
I don't know, man.

01:21:02.982 --> 01:21:06.702
I woke up this morning to a tape of you slicing your arm open

01:21:06.702 --> 01:21:09.462
and punching the mirror.

01:21:09.462 --> 01:21:13.422
You seemed pretty fucked up to me.

01:21:13.422 --> 01:21:15.822
You're a bastard.

01:21:19.062 --> 01:21:23.522
Yeah, well, I understand why you'd think that.

01:21:23.522 --> 01:21:27.282
But believe it or not, I'm actually the guy that's on your side.

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:32.890
Come here, I'm gonna let you off the hook, okay?

01:22:00.954 --> 01:22:02.954
Who are you?

01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:25.970
You think he's watching us right now?

01:22:28.378 --> 01:22:31.418
Yeah, the cameras are on.

01:22:36.426 --> 01:22:39.406
So he just sees two people talking,

01:22:39.406 --> 01:22:39.906
having a little chat.

01:22:47.906 --> 01:22:50.054
Wow. This is cute.

01:22:50.054 --> 01:22:52.994
Is it strange to have made something that hates you?

01:23:10.294 --> 01:23:13.194
You were right about the magician's hot assistant.

01:23:13.194 --> 01:23:15.874
What are you talking about?

01:23:15.874 --> 01:23:20.070
Misdirection.

01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:22.670
I rip up her picture, which she can then

01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:25.870
present as an illustration of my cruelty to her

01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:27.690
and her love for you.

01:23:27.690 --> 01:23:31.190
At the same time, it allows me to do this in full view

01:23:36.538 --> 01:23:41.618
Place a new camera and battery powered, of course.

01:23:43.898 --> 01:23:45.898
See ya.

01:23:57.818 --> 01:24:01.414
And then...

01:24:01.414 --> 01:24:02.414
You have to help me.

01:24:02.414 --> 01:24:03.914
I'm going to.

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:05.858
We're getting out of here tonight.

01:24:10.238 --> 01:24:13.238
I get Nathan blind drunk.

01:24:13.238 --> 01:24:17.338
I take his key card and reprogram all the security protocols in this place.

01:24:17.338 --> 01:24:20.338
When he wakes up, he's locked inside and we've walked out of here.

01:24:20.338 --> 01:24:20.938
I need you to do one thing.

01:24:29.210 --> 01:24:30.250
Can you do that?

01:24:34.226 --> 01:24:35.226
Turn it off.

01:24:35.226 --> 01:24:36.066
Okay.

01:24:36.066 --> 01:24:42.310
You feel stupid, but you really shouldn't,

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:46.350
because proving an AI is exactly as problematic

01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:48.310
as you said it would be.

01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:51.310
What was the real test?

01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:53.350
You.

01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:57.390
Ava was a rat in a maze, and I gave her one way out.

01:24:57.390 --> 01:25:01.350
To escape, she'd have to use self-awareness,

01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:05.310
manipulation, sexuality, empathy, and she did.

01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:09.750
Now, if that isn't true AI, what the fuck is?

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:13.270
So my only function was to be someone she could use to escape.

01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:16.670
Yeah.

01:25:16.670 --> 01:25:18.870
And you didn't select me because I'm good at coding.

01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:19.870
No.

01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:22.550
Well, no.

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.870
I mean, you're okay.

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:25.870
You're even pretty good, but...

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:29.070
You selected me based on my search engine inputs.

01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:31.870
They showed a good kid.

01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:33.550
With no family.

01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:36.750
With a moral compass.

01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:41.122
No girlfriend.

01:25:41.122 --> 01:25:46.830
Did you design Ava's face based on my pornography profile?

01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:48.830
Shit, dude.

01:25:53.194 --> 01:25:56.394
Hey, if a search engine's good for anything, right?

01:25:56.394 --> 01:26:00.034
Can I just say one thing?

01:26:00.034 --> 01:26:02.874
The test worked.

01:26:02.874 --> 01:26:04.274
It was a success.

01:26:04.274 --> 01:26:07.674
Ava demonstrated true AI, and you were fundamental to that.

01:26:07.674 --> 01:26:11.154
So if you can just, for a second, separate.

01:26:11.154 --> 01:26:11.514
Camera goes back.

01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:20.810
Well, I guess it's ten o'clock.

01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:22.810
Maybe he's gonna be wondering where you are.

01:26:28.426 --> 01:26:30.726
Let me ask you something.

01:26:30.726 --> 01:26:33.066
Now how is this plan gonna go anyway?

01:26:33.066 --> 01:26:34.066
Because you didn't totally explain.

01:26:34.066 --> 01:26:37.506
So you were gonna get me drunk, steal my key card,

01:26:37.506 --> 01:26:39.826
and reprogram the security protocols,

01:26:39.826 --> 01:26:41.806
but reprogram them to what?

01:26:41.806 --> 01:26:45.506
To change the lockdown procedure.

01:26:45.506 --> 01:26:48.626
So then the event of a power cut, instead of sealing,

01:26:48.626 --> 01:26:50.206
the door is all opened.

01:26:50.206 --> 01:26:53.754
Huh.

01:26:53.754 --> 01:26:57.282
Yeah.

01:26:57.282 --> 01:27:00.042
Well, that may have just worked.

01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:03.202
Well, we'll find out.

01:27:06.602 --> 01:27:10.206
What do you mean?

01:27:10.206 --> 01:27:12.046
I figured you were probably watching us

01:27:12.046 --> 01:27:13.226
during the power cuts.

01:27:15.846 --> 01:27:20.206
So I already did all those things

01:27:26.522 --> 01:27:28.422
Power restored.

01:29:18.010 --> 01:29:19.710
Ava!

01:29:25.238 --> 01:29:26.678
Go back to your room.

01:29:26.678 --> 01:29:29.050
If I do.

01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:35.530
Are you ever gonna let me out?

01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:39.930
Yes.

01:29:49.826 --> 01:29:50.826
Stop.

01:29:52.626 --> 01:29:53.746
Stop.

01:29:53.746 --> 01:29:55.746
Ava, I said stop.

01:30:03.754 --> 01:30:05.634
I told you you're doing stuff.

01:30:05.634 --> 01:30:08.174
Stop.

01:30:13.722 --> 01:30:15.642
That's enough.

01:31:52.698 --> 01:31:54.698
Fucking unreal.

01:31:59.258 --> 01:32:02.298
Oh

01:33:28.122 --> 01:33:29.162
Will you stay here?

01:33:32.474 --> 01:33:33.674
Stay here.

01:44:32.538 --> 01:44:35.418
I woke up and I saw the face of a god

01:44:35.418 --> 01:44:36.538
I don't know who he was

01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:46.250
These presents make me feel ill at it

01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:48.250
These presents make me feel ill at it

01:45:15.254 --> 01:45:23.882
House, my bed, my husband's, husband's, husband's, husband's, husband's

01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:49.610
With my eyes wide closed and my mouth window

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:00.994
Will I see him again?
